## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- ### Controller Layer (`internal/controller/`)
Generated by `gf gen ctrl`. Contains API controller stubs for handling HTTP requests.
These stubs should be implemented to handle requests, typically by calling the corresponding service interfaces in `internal/service/`.

- ### Service Layer (`internal/service/`)
Generated by `gf gen service`. Defines service interfaces that implement business rules. Controllers call service interfaces. Implementations are written in `internal/logic/`.

- ### Data Access Layer (`internal/dao/`)
Generated by `gf gen dao`. Provides type-safe access to database tables, including CRUD operations, transactions, and column definitions. Can be extended with custom DAO methods.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20+
- Docker & Docker Compose
### Running the application
```make
make dc-up
```
This starts all services (Go app, MySQL, Redis) via Docker Compose.

## Developer Guide ‚Äì GoFrame CLI
### Install GoFrame CLI
```bash
go install github.com/gogf/gf/cmd/gf/v2@latest
```

### Generate DAO / entity files from the database
```bash
gf gen dao
```
- Make sure your `hack/config.yaml` is configured with the correct database connection.

### Generate controllers
```bash
gf gen ctrl
```
- Requires API structs annotated in `api/` folder.
- Generates files under `internal/controller/`.

### Generate service interfaces
```bash
gf gen service
```
- Generates interfaces under `internal/service/`. 
- Implement logic in `internal/logic/` and register with service layer.
